# HumanoidRobotControlSystem_IntegratedC-Application-with_WebotsSimulator-and-NaoRobot


The project is based on developing software that provides control of the Nao robot. The aim is to test the robot in a virtual environment with the Webots simulator. In addition to moving the robot, this software can perceive the robot's environment with data received from its sensors.

Technologies and tools used in the project:

Webots Simulator: It is a simulator used to test the movements and sensor data of the Nao robot.
C++ Programming Language: The robot control system, class structures and menu management were developed in the C++ language.
Bitbucket: It was used to provide code sharing and version control among group members.
Doxygen: It was used to document project codes and create documentation in HTML format.
Project Features:

Robot Control System: Various classes (RobotControl, ForceSensor, SonarSensor, etc.) were developed to provide basic functions such as moving the Nao robot and collecting sensor data.
UML Diagrams: The UML diagrams used during the project design clearly reveal the relationships between classes and how the structures work.
Menu Design: A user-friendly text-based menu was created and submenus were developed to facilitate users in managing the robot.

Test Classes: Appropriate test modules were written for each class, thus verifying the operation of the software.

This project is a comprehensive example for students who aim to study software control and simulation of robotic systems. The project is built on the foundations of object-oriented programming and provides important skills in the design of such systems in practice.
